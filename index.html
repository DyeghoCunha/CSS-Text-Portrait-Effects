            Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. “
        “'Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
        Only this, and nothing more.”
    
        Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
        Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
        From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
        Nameless here for evermore.
    
        And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
        Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
        So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating, “
        “'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
        Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
        This it is, and nothing more.”
    
        Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
        “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
        But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
        And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
        That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—
        Darkness there, and nothing more.
    
        Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
        But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
        And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”
        This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—
        Merely this, and nothing more.
    
        Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
        Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
        “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice,
        Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
        Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
        'Tis the wind and nothing more.”
    
        Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
        In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.
        Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
        But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—
        Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
        Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
    
        Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
        By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.
        “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,
        Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
        Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!”
        Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
    
        Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
        Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
        For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
        Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door—
        Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
        With such name as “Nevermore.”
    
        But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
        That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
        Nothing further then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
        Till I scarcely more than muttered, “other friends have flown before—
        On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”
        Then the bird said, “Nevermore.”
    
        Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
        “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store,
        Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
        Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
        Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore,
        Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”
    
        But the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
        Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
        Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
        Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
        What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
        Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”
    
        This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
        To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
        This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
        On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,
        But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,
        She shall press, ah, nevermore!
    
        Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
        Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
        “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
        Respite—respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore;
        Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”
        Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
    
        “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
        Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
        Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
        On this home by horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
        Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”
        Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
    
        “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
        By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
        Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
        It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
        Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
        Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
    
        “Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—
        “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
        Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
        Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
        Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”
        Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
    
        And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
        On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
        And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
        And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
        And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
        Shall be lifted—nevermore!
        Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,

        And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
        Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
        So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating, “
        “'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
        Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
        This it is, and nothing more.”
    
        Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
        “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
        But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
        And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
        That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—
        Darkness there, and nothing more.
    
        Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
        But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
        And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”
        This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—
        Merely this, and nothing more.
    
        Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
        Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
        “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice,
        Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
        Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
        'Tis the wind and nothing more.”
    
        Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
        In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.
        Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
        But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—
        Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
        Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
    
        Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
        By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.
        “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,
        Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
        Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!”
        Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
    
        Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
        Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
        For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
        Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door—
        Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
        With such name as “Nevermore.”
    
        But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
        That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
        Nothing further then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
        Till I scarcely more than muttered, “other friends have flown before—
        On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”
        Then the bird said, “Nevermore.”
    
        Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
        “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store,
        Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
        Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
        Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore,
        Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”
    
        But the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
        Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
        Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
        Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
        What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
        Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”
    
        This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
        To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
        This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
        On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,
        But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,
        She shall press, ah, nevermore!
    
        Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
        Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
        “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
        Respite—respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore;
        Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”
        Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
    
        “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
        Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
        Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
        On this home by horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
        Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”
        Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
    
        “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
        By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
        Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
        It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
        Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
        Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
    
        “Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—
        “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
        Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
        Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
        Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”
        Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
    
        And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
        On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
        And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
        And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
        And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
        Shall be lifted—nevermore!
            Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. “
        “'Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
        Only this, and nothing more.”
    
        Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
        Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
        From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
        Nameless here for evermore.
    
        And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
        Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;

        Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
        “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice,
        Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
        Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
        'Tis the wind and nothing more.”
    
        Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
        In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.
        Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
        But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—
        Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
        Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
    
        Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
        By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.
        “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,
        Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
        Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!”
        Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
    
        Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
        Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
        For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
        Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door—
        Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
        With such name as “Nevermore.”
    
        But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
        That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
        Nothing further then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
        Till I scarcely more than muttered, “other friends have flown before—
        On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”
        Then the bird said, “Nevermore.”
    
        Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
        “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store,
        Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
        Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
        Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore,
        Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”
    
        But the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
        Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
        Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
        Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
        What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
        Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”
    
        This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
        To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
        This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
        On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,
        But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,
        She shall press, ah, nevermore!
    
        Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
        Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
        “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
        Respite—respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore;
        Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”
        Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
    
        “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
        Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
        Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
        On this home by horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
        Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”
        Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
    
        “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
        By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
        Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
        It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
        Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
        Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
    
        “Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—
        “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
        Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
        Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
        Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”
        Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
    
        And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
        On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
        And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
        And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
        And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
        Shall be lifted—nevermore!
        Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. “
        “'Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
        Only this, and nothing more.”
    
        Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
        Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
        From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
        Nameless here for evermore.
    
        And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
        Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
        So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating, “
        “'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
        Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
        This it is, and nothing more.”
    
        Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
        “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
        But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
        And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
        That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—
        Darkness there, and nothing more.
    
        Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
        But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
        And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”
        This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—
        Merely this, and nothing more.
    
        Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
        Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
        “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice,

            Tucano-toco O tucano-toco tem um grande bico alaranjado, com mancha negra na extremidade e estrias perpendiculares.Tucano-toco (Ramphastos toco) é o maior de todos os tucanos, atingindo, em média, 56 cm de comprimento e 540 gramas de massa. Também chamado de tucanuçu, pode ser observado em florestas do interior do Brasil e no Cerrado, onde ocorre em áreas semiabertas até regiões fechadas. A espécie pode ser vista com muita facilidade em nosso território, e também há registro dela em países como Paraguai, Bolívia e Argentina.O tucano-toco possui um bico largo e longo, com cerca de 20 cm, que apresenta uma cor alaranjada vibrante, uma mancha negra na extremidade e estrias rubras dispostas perpendicularmente ao eixo principal. Em relação à coloração de suas penas, o tucano-toco tem penas pretas em grande parte do seu corpo, sendo a região do pescoço de cor branca. Ao redor dos olhos, observa-se a pele nua, de cor laranja ou amarela. A pálpebra da espécie é azul-turquesa.Essa espécie se aimenta de frutos carnosos e arilos de sementes de várias espécies. Come ainda filhotes de aves de outras espécies e ovos.O tucano-toco vive em bandos compostos por cerca de 20 indivíduos. Durante a época reprodutiva, observa-se a formação de casais. Vale destacar que tucanos-tocos são monogâmicos. A nidificação ocorre em ocos de árvores, os quais são deixados no tamanho ideal pelo tucano. A fêmea coloca, em média, de dois a quatro ovos, incubados por aproximadamente 16 dias. A incubação é feita de maneira revezada entre os pais. A média de vida da espécie é de 40 anos.Leia mais: Corujas — aves, em sua maioria, de hábito noturno, predadoras e que têm um voo silenciosoTucano-de-bico-arco-írisTucano-de-bico-arco-íris de perfilO tucano-de-bico-arco-íris destaca-se por seu bico repleto de cores.
Como pontuado, os tucanos destacam-se, principalmente, por seu bico com cores vibrantes, sendo o tucano-de-bico-arco-íris (Ramphastos sulfuratus) uma espécie que impressiona nesse sentido.Também conhecido como tucano-de-peito-amarelo, destaca-se por ter bico com cor predominante verde amarelado. Ele apresenta uma faixa laranja na lateral inferior da maxila superior e uma mancha vermelha na ponta do bico. Na mandíbula, observa-se uma região azulada na porção posterior à ponta do bico. Ao redor dos olhos, a coloração é verde amarelado ou verde azulado.
A maior parte da plumagem dessa espécie é preta. Na região da garganta e do pescoço, no entanto, há penas amarelas. Daí o outro nome popular dado à espécie: tucano-de-peito-amarelo. Na região do peito, observa-se uma faixa avermelhada fina.Tucano-chocóTucano-chocó em galho na naturezaNessa espécie de tucano, observa-se uma diagonal lateral marrom-escuro ou preta no bico.O tucano-chocó (Ramphastos brevis) é encontrado na Colômbia e no Equador, e tem um bico com uma diagonal lateral marrom-escuro ou preta. O restante da maxila possui coloração amarelada, enquanto a mandíbula é marrom-escuro ou preta. Nessa espécie de tucano, a pálpebra e a região perioftálmica são da cor verde ou verde amarelado. As regiões do peito, pescoço e garganta são de coloração amarelada. Na região do peito, observa-se ainda um faixa branca seguida de uma vermelha.

Essa família está distribuída pela região Neotropical, sendo observados representantes dela desde o México até a Argentina. Nessas regiões, observa-se a presença dessas aves ocupando, geralmente, áreas de florestas tropicais, manchas florestais e florestas montanhosas.
Representantes dessa família possuem bico grande, recurvado, duro, cortante e bastante colorido. Apesar de seu tamanho, o bico dessas aves não é pesado. Isso se deve ao fato de que ele é formado por trabéculas ósseas, que têm aspecto esponjoso.Além da leveza, não podemos deixar de citar o formato do bico. Nesses animais, essa parte apresenta um formato que os ajuda a colherem frutos em locais que, geralmente, são inacessíveis para outras aves. Ele auxilia ainda na predação de ovos e na captura de filhotes em ninhos localizados no oco das árvores. O bico também ajuda a afugentar aves competidoras e na atração de parceiros.As penas das aves da família Ramphastidae apresentam, assim como os bicos, cores vivas, principalmente na região do papo. Os pés desses animais têm dois dedos voltados para frente e dois voltados para trás, sendo, portanto, zigodáctilos. Aves dessa família apresentam ainda uma glândula uropigiana bipartida.
